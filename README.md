### About Me... (。・ω・。)

Hi there, U can call me **Lave** or **Meowu** ( pronounce like a meow plus a U in word Ukraine I guess? )

I suffered. I hated. I was hated. I loved. I was loved. I'm in love. Many different phases shaped me.

Depression, happyness, love ... each of the emotions occupied me in my different ages ＞︿＜

All of them made me a empthetic, kind, cute person. Feel free to make friends with me then (´▽｀)
